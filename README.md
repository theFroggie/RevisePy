# RevisePy
An **open-source** python program to help you revise in the most optimal way.

## How it works
This program is still in development, so I will give an idea of what it **should** do.

- This program will be able to create and open revision sheet (made through the program) and make the user revise in 
  most optimal way (or close enough to it).

## Can I modify it?
Yes, it's an open-source program so anyone can modify it and bring modifications to it.
